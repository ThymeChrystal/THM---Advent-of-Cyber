# The background story - How the Glitch stole SOC-mas
> This is copied from the room's background description.

The snow is falling on the tech town of Wareville, and all the different Ware families are gathering in the town square, getting ready for a town meeting. We see the Softwares and the Freewares, skating down the neon-lit frostlanes. We turn to Server Street, and see the Hardwares and the Firmwares marching downtown, festive server lights blinking and flickering in their eyes. It’s time to start preparing for SOC-mas, the most joyous time of the year in the tech town of Wareville.

If we lift our eyes, we’ll see, beyond the buzzing city, a snow-covered mountain of discarded technology. Boulders of old printers, cracked monitor cliffs, and server rack ridges, held together by vines of ethernet cables, and a single old gaming chair at the peak - this is Mount Hackit, and no Wares dare to go there. They fear it not because of the frequent floppy disk avalanches, the Wares avoid Mount Hackit because of the Glitch.

The Glitch’s lair is hidden in a deep cave, and he’s there now. He grabs a few cables hanging from the ceiling and plugs them in. Although not as new and shiny as Wareville’s, his servers work just fine! The Glitch has been watching Wareville’s security for years, and this SOC-mas will not be different. The Wares might fear the Glitch, thinking he is an evil hacker, but it doesn’t matter. Cracking his fingers, he starts typing, establishing the connection to the town’s network. Time to hack!

Back in the town square, Marta May Ware, the SOC-mas organiser, is climbing up on the stage to address the town when all the lights suddenly flicker. All the Wares look around, confused, but it passes quickly, and everything returns to normal.

In the city hall, Mayor Malware slams his fists on his desk. “Blocked again!” he shouts angrily. “That insufferable Glitch is at it again!” The mayor’s plan to stop SOC-mas preparation by sabotaging tonight's meeting was unsuccessful. He’ll have to think of something better for tomorrow…

In the meantime, Wareville’s SOC is in chaos. Analysts are trying to discover what caused the sudden power surge that threatened all tech in the town. McSkidy Software, the town’s leading cyber security expert, points at a log file on the screen and exclaims, “Now, I don’t know exactly what happened, but this proves we had a connection from Mount Hackit!” McSkidy runs out of the SOC and heads up the mountain. When she reaches the cave, she does not expect to see the Glitch waiting for her, two cups of hot cocoa in his hands, and his dog curled up at his feet.

It takes most of the evening, but the Glitch explains what he’s been doing: protecting the town from Mayor Malware’s evil plans. It looks like the mayor wants to completely stop SOC-mas from happening this year! The Glitch knows the Wares might mistrust or hate him, but he wants to help.

Now, united by a common purpose, McSkidy and the Glitch start their work in the Mount Hackit cave, because they’re the only ones standing between Wareville and chaos.
